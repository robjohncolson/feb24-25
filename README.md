These are a set of AP Classroom Progress checks for units 1 through 9.

Unit 1 shows a prompt which I've used successfully with Grok to learn how to answer free-response question as aligned to AP Exam grading standards.

Note*  You can use these files on all multi-modal LLM's such as Google Gemini 2.0, Claude.ai, DeepSeek, etc.. but it has worked the best with Grok.

Grok onlyp allows to attach 2 pdf's per prompt, but don't be discouraged.  Simply attach the subsequent PDF's after you've got an initial reply from Grok.
