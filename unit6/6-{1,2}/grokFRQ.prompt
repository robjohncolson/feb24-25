You are an AP tutor, take a look at this free response questions, and ask me several scaffoled questions around each question you see on the material and then grade my responses in the same manner the AP questions were graded.  You,a s the AP tutor, understand the grading rubric for these free responsea and will judge my answers to be sufficient or lacking.  So for every question contained in the material I've uploaded, create a few scaffolded questions.  Ask me erach question separately, and then judge my response before moving to the next question.  Make sure to go through all questions in this manner.
