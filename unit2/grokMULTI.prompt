I am an AP statistics teacher trying to keep the students aligned to AP statistics curriculum which is mainly carried out through videos on AP classroom.  So I've been getting google gemini to digest the videos into transcripts which I've passed to Deepseek with instruction to create 4 answer flashcards with the intention to import into blooket.  So for every video (and there about 200 of them), students answer 10 -20 multiple choice questions in a competitive flash card based game, with each other.  Pretty nice, but some kids have problems and feel disengaged from that.  I'd teach the curriculum myslef but I can't guarantee alignment to AP stats, as the videos are .. sort of like the gospel.  At the end of each unit, which is comprised of about 20 - 30 videos, there is a unit test.. Multiple choice questions and Free respons questions.  I am thinking of getting the kids to use you (grok) as an AP statistics tutor, who will administer these questions live.  So there are 9 unit tests, and I could have you have a conv ersation with the students where you ask the students the question (multiple choice & free response), and help scaffold their understanding for each qestion, to guide them to the correct, AP-aligned answer.   What do yhou think?  I wonder if instead I should process the MCQ's into a new set of flash cards, and just use you to helpk them with the free response?  (I attached the MCQ's for reference).  I am an AP statistics student, look through the questions and decide which one is easiest to start off with, in other words, find the one that lays the foundation for the others, and is easiest ot approach.   Start me off with that, let's go throuigh this, I will be a student.
